# StarbucksLandingPage

This is one of the Landing Page of the Famous Starbucks Coffee. The project contains an HTML and a CSS file with a very minimal JS coding.
I have created a separate images folder and have stored all the images used in the project under it. 
Also, before starting the project you can exactly see the output too by checking the output image.
Please find the deployment link here for the following project: https://starbucks-home-page.netlify.app/
